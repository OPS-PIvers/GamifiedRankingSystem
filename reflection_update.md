# The Reflection Log

## For each week, you must complete the following in your log. A new entry should be made for each Friday.

### Date and Time: Note the date and the specific 40-45 minute block you dedicated to the assignment.

### Media Title and Type: Provide the full title of the media and its type (e.g., film, podcast, novel).

### Mythological Connection: In 2-3 sentences, explain how the modern piece of media incorporates mythology. If it draws directly from mythology, which specific myth, character, or pantheon is featured and how it is represented in the media? If it is more inspired by myths, what elements of mythology does it incorporate? Does it create its own gods? Does it follow a hero’s journey? Does it connect to archetypes?

### Analysis: In 4-5 sentences, discuss one key theme or question. For example, how does the media's portrayal differ from the original myth? Is the myth used for a different purpose than its original context (e.g., to tell a superhero story or a love story)? What does this reinterpretation say about our modern understanding of the myth?

# Example Log Entry

## Date and Time: Friday, Sept 12, 2025, 1:00 PM - 1:45 PM 

## Media Title and Type: The Lightning Thief (film) 

## Mythological Connection: The film is based on Greek mythology, specifically featuring characters like Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades, and mythical creatures such as the Minotaur and Medusa. It re-imagines the story of Percy Jackson, a modern-day demigod and son of Poseidon. 

## Analysis: The movie takes a very simplified approach to the myths, often sanitizing or altering key details to fit a modern-day quest narrative. For instance, the gods are portrayed more as feuding family members rather than the complex, often cruel figures of the original myths. This reinterpretation makes the gods more relatable, but it loses some of the original myth's power and darker themes.
